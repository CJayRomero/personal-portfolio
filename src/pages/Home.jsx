      <h2>Aspiring Graphic Artist / Designer</h2>
      <p>Hi, Iâ€™m Christian Jay Romero â€” a passionate graphic artist and designer inspired by Y2K Futurism and Frutiger Aero aesthetics. I love blending nostalgic, retro-futuristic visuals with modern creativity, designing logos, illustrations, and immersive textures for games. Iâ€™m currently learning 3D modeling, PBR texturing, and motion graphics to expand my creative skills. My goal is to craft visuals that spark imagination, capture emotion, and leave a lasting impression.</p>
      <p>ðŸŽ® I love to play videogames</p>
